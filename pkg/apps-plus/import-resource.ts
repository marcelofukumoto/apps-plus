// Turning a live Kubernetes object into a template.
//
// A resource read out of a cluster is not a manifest. It carries what the apiserver wrote on it
// (uid, resourceVersion, managedFields), what the scheduler and the controllers decided
// (clusterIP, nodeName, volumeName), what whatever deployed it left behind (Helm's and Fleet's
// annotations), and a full `status`. Applying that verbatim to a different cluster fails, and
// applying it to the same one quietly re-adopts somebody else's object. So the value of this
// import is almost entirely in what it takes out.
//
// It is a pure function on purpose: no store, no fetch, no Vue. What it does is the part worth
// being able to reason about, and it should be readable without any of that.

/**
 * YAML for a template, with whole-value placeholders left unquoted.
 *
 * `jsyaml.dump` quotes `${replicas}` because a plain scalar may not begin with `{` and it will
 * not reason about the `$` in front. That is correct YAML and the wrong thing here: the quotes
 * survive substitution, so `replicas: '${replicas}'` becomes `replicas: '1'` and the apiserver
 * refuses it - `cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field DeploymentSpec.spec.replicas of
 * type int32`. A template that saves cleanly and fails on install is the worst kind of wrong.
 *
 * Only a value that is *entirely* one placeholder is unquoted, which is what makes this safe.
 * `name: '${install}-hello-site'` keeps its quotes and stays a string, as a name should; only
 * `${replicas}` and `${image}`, which stand alone, are freed to become whatever they are given.
