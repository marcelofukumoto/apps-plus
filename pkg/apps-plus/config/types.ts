 * The product these pages live under, which is Rancher's own Fleet - Continuous Delivery in the
 * side menu - rather than a product of this extension's own.
 *
 * It belongs there: an App is a definition and an Installation is one deployment of it by
 * Fleet, so the list sits beside the Git Repos and Helm Ops that are the other two ways to have
 * Fleet deploy something. Fleet's product declares `extendable: true` for exactly this.
 *
 * Everything else follows from this constant: the models build their route locations from it,
 * so the pages move with it and nothing else needed changing.
